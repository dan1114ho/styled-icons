`styled-icons` provides the [Material Design][2] and [Octicons][2] icon packs as [Styled Components][3], with full support for TypeScript types and ES6 modules / tree-shaking.

## Installation

```
yarn add styled-icons
```

or

```
npm install styled-icons --save
```

Additionally, you will need to have installed a version of `styled-components`, as `styled-icons` depends on it as a peer dependency.

## Usage

All Material and Octicon icons are available for preview at the [Icon Explorer][0].

The entire icon packs are available via the main import and sub-imports:

```javascript
import {material, octicons} from 'styled-icons'

import * as material from 'styled-icons/material'
import * as octicons from 'styled-icons/octicons'
```

The icons are also available as individual imports - it is recommended that you import icons individually using ES modules along with a module bundler like Webpack or Rollup in order to enable tree-shaking. This means that the module bundler will remove unused icons from the final JavaScript bundle, saving bandwidth and speeding up loading:

```javascript
import React, {Fragment} from 'react'
import {Account, Lock} from 'styled-icons/material'

const App = () => (
  <Fragment>
    <Account />
    <Lock />
  </Fragment>
)
```

### Props

Styled Icons accept all the valid props of an `<svg />` element, in addition to a `size` convenience prop that sets both `width` and `height`:

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import {Lock} from 'styled-icons/material'

const App = () => <Lock size="48" />
```

### Dimensions

Some icons natively have non-square dimensions - original dimensions are exported from the individual icon exports:

```javascript
import {LogoGithub, LogoGithubDimensions} from 'styled-icons/octicons/LogoGithub'

const App = () => <LogoGithub />

console.log(LogoGithubDimension) // {height: 16, width: 45}
```

Dimension exports are not available on the icon pack or index exports:

```javascript
import * as octicons from 'styled-icons/octicons'
import {octicons} from 'styled-icons'

// octicons contains only icon exports
```

### Styled Components

All icons are exported as [Styled Components][3], which means it is possible to extend their styles or otherwise utilize the Styled Components API:

```javascript
import {Lock} from 'styled-icons/material'

export const RedLock = Lock.extend`
  color: red;

  font-weight: ${props => (props.important ? 'bold' : 'normal')};
`
```

### TypeScript

The icons of `styled-icons` are built using TypeScript and export type definitions. By default, the `theme` prop is typed as `any`, but if you would like to override the theme interface, this is possible via the `StyledIcon` type:

```typescript
import {StyledIcon} from 'styled-icons/material'
import {Lock} from 'styled-icons/material'

interface ThemeInterface {
  lockColor: string
}

export const ThemedLock: StyledIcon<ThemeInterface> = Lock.extend`
  color: ${props => props.theme.lockColor};
`
```

If you have any ideas for improvements to the TypeScript typing, please open an issue or PR!
